# File-Encryption--Decryption-project
This project focuses on securing files by implementing encryption and decryption techniques to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Users can encrypt a file using a secure algorithm and later decrypt it using the correct key or password. This system ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and security.

Installation & Setup
1. Install Dependencies
Ensure Python is installed, then install the required libraries:
pip install cryptography

2. Run the Application
Execute the Python script:
python main.py

Usage Guide
ðŸ”‘ Generate Encryption Key
Click the "Generate Key" button.
Choose a location to save the generated key file.
The key file will be stored in the selected location.

ðŸ”’ Encrypt Files
Click the "Encrypt" button.
Select the key file that was generated earlier.
Choose one or more files to encrypt.
The selected files will be encrypted and replaced with encrypted versions.

ðŸ”“ Decrypt Files
Click the "Decrypt" button.
Select the same key file used for encryption.
Choose one or more encrypted files to decrypt.
The files will be restored to their original form.
Error Handling
If no key or file is selected, an error message is displayed.
If an invalid key file is used, an error is shown.
Future Enhancements
ðŸ”¹ Improve UI with better design.
ðŸ”¹ Add password protection for key files.
ðŸ”¹ Support for bulk encryption and decryption.

ðŸš€ Enjoy Secure File Encryption & Decryption!
